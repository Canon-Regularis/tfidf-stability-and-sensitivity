# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this repository.

This project is maintained as a **solo research and reference artefact**. It is intended to provide a stable,  
self-contained exposition of TF-IDF–based similarity systems and their numerical stability properties.  
As such, the repository is **not open to external contributions** in the form of pull requests, feature  
requests, or design proposals.

---

## Contribution Policy

- Pull requests are **not accepted** and will not be reviewed.
- Feature requests, enhancements, and design discussions are **not accepted**.
- This repository is not maintained as a collaborative or community-driven project.

These restrictions are intentional and reflect the repository’s role as a **fixed analytical reference** rather  
than an evolving software system.

## Errors and Clarifications

Reasonable efforts will be made to respond to **reports of factual errors, mathematical mistakes, or clarifications**  
related to the exposition. Any such review is conducted on a **best-effort basis**, without guarantee of response  
or incorporation.

Reports should focus on **correctness**, rather than extensions or alternative implementations.

## Rationale

Restricting contributions helps ensure:
