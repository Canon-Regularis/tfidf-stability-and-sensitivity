# Numerical Stability and Perturbation Behaviour in TF-IDF-Based Similarity Systems

## Abstract

This repository presents a **self-contained implementation and analysis** of a 
**TF-IDF–based document similarity and ranking system**, written to make the 
**algebraic structure and perturbation behaviour** of the pipeline explicit.

Documents are embedded using **explicit tokenisation**, **n-gram construction**, 
**smoothed inverse document frequency (IDF)**, and **sparse TF-IDF vectors**, with 
similarity measured via **cosine similarity** and rankings induced through a 
deterministic sorting procedure. The implementation exposes intermediate quantities 
such as document frequencies, IDF weights, vector norms, and similarity scores. These 
enable direct examination of how corpus structure and similarity geometry relate to ranking 
behaviour under perturbation.

Beyond analysing numerical sensitivity of TF-IDF embeddings and cosine similarity, 
the repository studies **ranking stability** as a first-class object. Stability is 
characterised empirically using **score-separation margins**, including boundary 
margins governing top-k membership and adjacent margins controlling ordering within 
top-k results. These margins yield explicit, sufficient conditions under which rankings 
remain invariant under bounded perturbations of similarity scores.

The work further isolates **decision-level discontinuities** introduced by deterministic 
**tie-breaking rules**, demonstrating that ranking outcomes may change even when cosine 
similarity scores are equal within numerical tolerance. This separation between 
**numerical stability of similarity scores** and **stability of induced rankings** 
highlights structural sources of fragility in similarity-based retrieval and 
content-based recommendation systems.

## 1. Introduction

This project examines the numerical stability of **TF-IDF–based similarity and ranking systems** 
under small perturbations in data and preprocessing.

TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) is a foundational technique in 
**information retrieval** and **text-based modelling**. It represents documents as 
vectors in a **high-dimensional feature space**, where similarity is typically measured 
using **cosine similarity**. Despite its widespread use, the behaviour of TF-IDF-based 
pipelines under perturbations - such as changes in corpus composition, token 
distributions, or preprocessing rules - is rarely analysed in a systematic and explicit 
manner.

This work studies TF-IDF in a controlled setting where documents arise from 
**text of interest** and similarity scores are used to induce 
**content-based k-nearest-neighbour (k-NN) rankings**. The system is implemented in 
**pure Python**, with explicit control over preprocessing, vocabulary construction, 
IDF computation, vector formation, and ranking. This explicit formulation enables 
direct examination of how corpus structure and similarity geometry relate to similarity 
scores, neighbourhood structure, and ranking behaviour under perturbation.

The central question is one of stability:  
**how sensitive are TF-IDF weights, cosine similarities, and induced rankings to small 
changes in the underlying data?** 
More specifically, this work addresses two closely related aspects of this question: 
(i) how **score-separation margins** govern the stability of similarity-based rankings 
under bounded perturbations, and 
(ii) how **deterministic tie-breaking rules** introduce discontinuities in ranking 
outcomes that are independent of numerical error in similarity computation.

---

## 1.1 Purpose and Research Intent

The purpose of this repository is **investigative rather than applicative**. Although 
TF-IDF is a *classical method*, the aim is to examine the **mathematical structures 
induced by the TF-IDF pipeline** and to understand how these structures behave under 
controlled variation of assumptions and parameters, particularly in the context of 
**content-based similarity** and **k-nearest-neighbour ranking**.

Rather than treating the similarity pipeline as a black box, the implementation 
explicitly exposes **preprocessing operations**, **n-gram structure**, 
**document-frequency thresholds**, **IDF scaling**, and **sparse vector geometry**. 
This level of explicitness supports detailed analysis of **sensitivity** and 
**stability phenomena** in TF-IDF embeddings, cosine similarity, and induced 
k-NN neighbourhoods. In particular, it enables investigation of situations in which 
small perturbations in documents, corpus composition, or user-derived profiles lead 
to **disproportionate changes** in similarity scores, neighbourhood structure, or 
ranking outcomes.

In addition to numerical sensitivity at the level of embeddings and similarity scores, 
the repository treats **ranking stability as a primary object of analysis**. Stability 
is operationalised using **empirical score-separation margin distributions**, which 
quantify the tolerance of ranking outcomes to bounded perturbations. Separately, the 
work isolates **instability arising solely from deterministic tie-breaking rules**, 
demonstrating how ranking outcomes may change even when similarity scores are equal 
within numerical tolerance.

Empirical investigations in this repository focus primarily on score-level and 
decision-level perturbations, while corpus- and embedding-level effects are 
analysed analytically to characterise their influence on downstream stability.

---

## 1.2 Investigative Scope

By retaining access to **intermediate quantities** that are typically abstracted away 
in higher-level libraries, the repository supports systematic investigation of questions 
including:

- the effect of corpus perturbations on **document frequency** and **smoothed IDF values**,  
- the response of **TF-IDF embeddings** to token-level edits or preprocessing changes,  
- the sensitivity of **cosine similarity** to perturbations in *sparse, non-negative vectors*,  
- conditions under which **similarity-based rankings** and **k-NN neighbourhoods** remain  
  invariant under bounded perturbations,  
- the influence of **user-profile construction** on personalised similarity and  
  neighbourhood structure,  
- **margin distributions** governing the stability of top-k membership and ordering  
  within top-k results,  
- **tie-group analysis**, quantifying ranking changes induced by deterministic  
  tie-breaking rules when similarity scores fall within numerical tolerance.

This level of access connects **formal derivation** with **empirical observation** and 
makes the framework suitable for studying **conditioning behaviour**, **perturbation 
effects**, and **ranking stability** in TF-IDF-based similarity systems.

---

## 1.3 Position Within a Broader Mathematical Context

TF-IDF–based similarity lies at the intersection of **information retrieval**, 
**numerical linear algebra**, **finite-dimensional functional analysis**, and 
**probabilistic models of text**. The construction provides a concrete setting in which 
abstract numerical phenomena - such as **sparsity**, **scaling behaviour**, 
**angular distortion**, and **perturbation amplification** - can be observed and 
analysed directly.

From a decision-theoretic perspective, similarity-based ranking may be viewed as a 
**piecewise-constant functional of similarity scores**, with **discontinuities induced 
by secondary ordering and tie-breaking rules**. This perspective clarifies the 
distinction between numerical stability of the underlying similarity computation and 
stability of the induced ranking outcomes.

These issues recur in **high-dimensional feature representations** used in machine 
learning, **content-based similarity and recommendation systems**, and **retrieval 
pipelines**, where numerical sensitivity and decision discontinuities can have practical 
consequences. Accordingly, this work is positioned as an **expository and exploratory 
study** of established mathematical constructions within a TF-IDF setting, with 
particular attention to their behaviour under perturbation and their implications for 
ranking stability and interpretability.

---

## 1.4 Intended Use

This repository is **not intended as a production-grade recommendation library**. 
Instead, it serves as a **reference implementation**, an **exploratory mathematical 
environment**, and a foundation for *small-scale research investigations* into 
TF-IDF representations, cosine similarity, content-based k-NN ranking, and 
ranking stability.

The emphasis throughout is on understanding **mathematical behaviour**, particularly 
**conditioning**, **sensitivity**, and **perturbation effects** in sparse vector spaces, 
as well as the relationship between numerical similarity computation and downstream 
ranking decisions. These considerations are central to the **reliability**, 
**reproducibility**, and **interpretability** of similarity-based and content-based 
recommendation models.

---

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

Let  
𝒟 = { d₁, …, dₙ }  
be a finite corpus of preprocessed documents, and define N := |𝒟|. Each document dᵢ is a
finite sequence of tokens obtained from raw text via a fixed preprocessing map
(normalisation, stopword removal, lemmatisation, and n-gram generation). Throughout,
**n-grams are treated as atomic tokens**.

All preprocessing operations are assumed to be deterministic and fixed across all
perturbation experiments.

---

### 2.1 Vocabulary, Document Frequency, and IDF

From the corpus 𝒟, a vocabulary V is constructed by collecting all tokens (including
n-grams) that satisfy a minimum document-frequency threshold and, optionally, a
maximum-feature constraint. For each token t ∈ V, the document frequency is defined as

df(t) = |{ i : t appears at least once in dᵢ }|.

Let N = |𝒟|. The smoothed inverse document frequency used throughout the implementation is

idf(t) = log((1 + N) / (1 + df(t))) + 1.

This choice ensures monotonic decay of idf(t) as df(t) increases. The additive constant
ensures strict positivity even in the limiting case df(t) = N.

(Here and throughout, log denotes the natural logarithm.)

---

### 2.2 TF-IDF Embedding

For each document dᵢ, let countᵢ(t) denote the number of occurrences of token t ∈ V in
dᵢ. The term frequency is defined as

tfᵢ(t) = countᵢ(t) / ∑ₛ∈V countᵢ(s).

That is, term frequencies are normalised with respect to **in-vocabulary tokens**, with
out-of-vocabulary tokens ignored after vocabulary construction. Documents whose
in-vocabulary token count is zero are mapped to the zero vector.

The TF-IDF weight of token t in document dᵢ is then

wᵢ(t) = tfᵢ(t) · idf(t),

and the document is represented as a sparse vector

wᵢ ∈ ℝ≥0^|V|,

with coordinates indexed by the vocabulary V.

---

### 2.3 Cosine Similarity, Ranking, and Stability Quantities

Given two non-zero TF-IDF vectors u, v ∈ ℝ≥0^|V|, the cosine similarity is defined as

cos(u, v) = (u · v) / (‖u‖₂ ‖v‖₂),

with the convention that the similarity is set to zero if either vector is the zero
vector. Since all coordinates are non-negative, it follows that

cos(u, v) ∈ [0, 1].

Given a query vector q ∈ ℝ≥0^|V|, embedded using the same vocabulary V and IDF mapping as
the corpus documents, and a collection of document vectors { wᵢ }, similarity scores

sᵢ = cos(q, wᵢ)

are computed for each document.

---

#### 2.3.1 Ranking Operator

Similarity scores alone do not define a total order when ties occur. Accordingly, the
final ranking is defined via a deterministic sorting operator

π = Sort((sᵢ, aᵢ)ᵢ),

where Sort orders documents by decreasing similarity score sᵢ and resolves ties
lexicographically using the fixed attribute tuple aᵢ (e.g. popularity, rating,
engagement, identifier). This yields a total ordering (r₁, r₂, …, rₙ), where rⱼ denotes
the document at rank j.

As a consequence, the mapping from similarity scores to rankings is not continuous
globally; it is locally constant away from tie hyperplanes. 

---

#### 2.3.2 Score-Separation Margins (A1)

Let score(rⱼ) denote the similarity score of the document at rank j. The **boundary margin**
at rank k is defined as

mₖ = score(rₖ) − score(rₖ₊₁).

This quantity governs the stability of top-k membership under bounded perturbations of
similarity scores.

The **minimum adjacent margin within the top-k** is defined as

m_min^top = min_{1 ≤ j < k} (score(rⱼ) − score(rⱼ₊₁)).

This quantity controls the stability of the ordering within the top-k set.

For convenience, the corresponding **flip radius** at rank k is defined as

εₖ^flip = mₖ / 2,

representing the largest uniform perturbation magnitude (in score space) under which the
relative ordering of ranks k and k + 1 is preserved.

---

#### 2.3.3 Tie Groups and Decision Discontinuities (A2)

Fix the ranking  
(r₁, r₂, …, rₙ)  
induced by the deterministic ranking operator π.

To formalise near-ties, fix a numerical tolerance τ > 0. For a given rank position j, the
associated **tie group** is defined as

G_τ(j) = { i : |sᵢ − score(rⱼ)| ≤ τ }.

Here the scores sᵢ are the same similarity scores used to produce the ranking
(rⱼ)

Documents within a tie group are indistinguishable at the level of similarity scores up
to numerical tolerance. In such cases, the final ordering within G_τ(j) is determined
entirely by the deterministic tie-breaking rules embedded in the ranking operator π.

This construction makes explicit the distinction between **numerical stability of
similarity scores** and **stability of the induced ranking**, and provides a formal
basis for analysing decision-level discontinuities arising from secondary ordering
criteria.

---

## 3. Solution Procedure and Implementation Structure

The repository implements the TF-IDF pipeline and associated perturbation-theoretic
investigations in a **fully explicit and reproducible** manner. Each stage of the
pipeline is designed to expose **intermediate quantities** and **algebraic structure**,
rather than to optimise performance or abstract away implementation details.

- **Preprocessing and Corpus Construction**  
  A fixed, deterministic preprocessing map is applied to raw **text of interest**,
  including normalisation, tokenisation, stopword removal, lemmatisation, and n-gram
  generation. This yields a reproducible corpus suitable for **controlled perturbation
  analysis** via explicit inspection of intermediate quantities.

- **TF-IDF Vectorisation**  
  A pure-Python TF-IDF vectoriser constructs the vocabulary, computes document
  frequencies and smoothed inverse document frequency (IDF) values, and embeds documents
  as vectors in ℝ≥0^|V|. In typical use, these embeddings are sparse due to the size of
  the vocabulary relative to document length.

- **Similarity, Ranking, and k-NN Structure**  
  Cosine similarity is computed between query vectors and corpus vectors, followed by
  deterministic ranking. In the context of **content-based k-nearest-neighbour
  recommendation**, the top-k elements of this ranking define the neighbourhood
  associated with a query. Secondary attributes, such as auxiliary metadata or
  identifiers, are applied via lexicographic tie-breaking, yielding a **total order** on
  candidate items.  
  In addition to score computation, the implementation explicitly computes
  **score-separation margins** governing top-k membership and within-top-k ordering, and
  supports stability profiling of rankings under bounded perturbations. Observed
  score-separation margins are used as empirical certificates of stability, rather
  than relying on explicit noise injection. The ranking procedure is further instrumented
  to enable **tie-breaking ablation experiments**, in which ordering is recomputed under
  alternate tie-break priorities or using score-only sorting with a fixed, attribute-independent
  identifier as a final deterministic tie-break, thereby isolating decision-level
  effects attributable to secondary attributes from numerical similarity computation.

- **User-Profile Documents**  
  User-specific documents are constructed from interactions such as liked, viewed, or
  favourited items. These user-profile documents are embedded using the **same
  vocabulary and IDF mapping as the corpus**, ensuring that all similarity computations
  take place in a common vector space.

- **Perturbation Analysis**  
  The explicit structure of the implementation supports analytical study and
  targeted empirical inspection of how small perturbations in documents, corpus
  composition, or user interactions propagate through document frequencies, IDF
  values, TF-IDF embeddings, cosine similarities, induced k-NN neighbourhoods,
  and ranking outcomes. In particular, the framework enables examination of mechanisms
  that can amplify small upstream perturbations, arising from interactions between the sparse
  vector geometry, IDF scaling, angular similarity, and deterministic decision rules.

The code is organised to preserve **algebraic clarity** and to expose intermediate
quantities at every stage. As such, it is well suited as a basis for further
mathematical analysis of **stability**, **sensitivity**, and **decision-level
fragility** in TF-IDF-based similarity systems.

All stages of the pipeline are deterministic given a fixed corpus, configuration, and
software environment (including library versions), ensuring reproducible similarity
scores and rankings across runs.

## 4. Error Analysis and Perturbation Quantities

Let wᵢ denote the TF-IDF vector associated with document dᵢ, and let

sᵢ = cos(q, wᵢ)

denote the similarity score between a query vector q and the i-th document. This section
introduces quantitative measures for analysing how perturbations affect intermediate
quantities in the TF-IDF pipeline and how these effects translate to similarity scores
and induced rankings.

Throughout, perturbations are treated as **bounded changes** in intermediate numerical
quantities. No probabilistic or adversarial noise model is assumed unless stated
explicitly. In the implementation, such perturbations are analysed primarily at 
the level of similarity scores and induced rankings, with upstream effects treated 
analytically.

---

### 4.1 Perturbations in Document Frequency and IDF

Consider a perturbation of the corpus induced by adding or removing a document, or by
modifying the token content of an existing document. Let df(t) and df′(t) denote the
document frequencies of token t before and after perturbation, and let N and N′ denote
the corresponding corpus sizes.

Using the smoothed IDF definition employed throughout the implementation,

idf(t) = log((1 + N) / (1 + df(t))) + 1,

the corresponding change in IDF is

Δidf(t) = idf′(t) − idf(t)  
    = log((1 + N′)/(1 + df′(t))) − log((1 + N)/(1 + df(t))).

This expression makes explicit the competing effects of changes in corpus size and
document-frequency distribution on IDF values. In particular, tokens with low document
frequency remain sensitive to corpus perturbations even under smoothing.

---

### 4.2 Perturbations in TF-IDF Vectors

Let wᵢ and wᵢ′ denote the TF-IDF vectors of a document before and after perturbation.
Writing

wᵢ  = tfᵢ ⊙ idf  
wᵢ′ = tfᵢ′ ⊙ idf′

where ⊙ denotes pointwise (Hadamard) multiplication, we obtain

wᵢ′ − wᵢ  
= (Δtfᵢ) ⊙ idf + tfᵢ ⊙ (Δidf) + (Δtfᵢ) ⊙ (Δidf),

with Δtfᵢ := tfᵢ′ − tfᵢ and Δidf := idf′ − idf.

Applying the inequality ‖a ⊙ b‖₂ ≤ ‖a‖₂ ‖b‖∞ termwise yields the bound

‖wᵢ′ − wᵢ‖₂ ≤ ‖Δtfᵢ‖₂ · ‖idf‖∞  
       + ‖tfᵢ‖₂ · ‖Δidf‖∞  
       + ‖Δtfᵢ‖₂ · ‖Δidf‖∞.

This decomposition separates perturbations arising from **local document edits**
(Δtfᵢ), **global corpus changes** (Δidf), and their interaction. In sparse
high-dimensional embeddings, the interaction between local changes and globally scaled
IDF weights provides a natural mechanism for perturbation amplification.

---

### 4.3 Perturbations in Cosine Similarity

Let u, v be TF-IDF vectors and let u′, v′ denote their perturbed counterparts. Under
mild assumptions on the norms of these vectors, a standard inequality yields

|cos(u′, v′) − cos(u, v)| ≤ C (‖u′ − u‖₂ + ‖v′ − v‖₂),

for a constant C depending on lower and upper bounds on ‖u‖₂, ‖v‖₂, ‖u′‖₂, and ‖v′‖₂.

This establishes a Lipschitz-type bound governing **score stability** under bounded
perturbations of TF-IDF vectors. Such bounds control the magnitude of numerical changes
in similarity scores but do not, by themselves, determine the stability of induced
rankings when deterministic tie-breaking rules are present (see §4.5), particularly in 
regimes where score-separation margins are small or ties are present.

---

### 4.4 Ranking Stability via Score-Separation Margins (A1)

Let (r₁, r₂, …, rₙ) denote the ranking induced by sorting similarity scores in decreasing
order, and let score(rⱼ) denote the similarity score of the document at rank j.

The **boundary margin** at rank k is defined as

mₖ = score(rₖ) − score(rₖ₊₁).

If similarity scores are subject to a uniform perturbation bounded by ε, i.e.

|Δsᵢ| ≤ ε  for all i,

then the top-k set is invariant under perturbation whenever

ε < mₖ / 2.

Similarly, the **minimum adjacent margin within the top-k** is defined as

m_min^top = min_{1 ≤ j < k} (score(rⱼ) − score(rⱼ₊₁)).

Under the same uniform bound, the ordering within the top-k set is preserved whenever

ε < m_min^top / 2.

These conditions provide explicit, sufficient criteria for ranking stability in terms
of score-separation margins. They depend only on similarity scores and do not account
for secondary ordering rules applied in the presence of ties.

---

### 4.5 Tie-Breaking Discontinuities and Decision Sensitivity (A2)

Let aᵢ denote a vector of secondary attributes associated with document i (e.g.
popularity, rating, engagement, identifier). The final ranking operator is defined as

π = Sort(sᵢ, aᵢ),

where similarity scores form the primary key and secondary attributes are applied
lexicographically to resolve ties.

To isolate the effect of tie-breaking, define a **score-only ranking**

π_score = Sort(sᵢ, idᵢ),

where idᵢ is a fixed, stable identifier used solely to impose a deterministic but
attribute-independent order among equal scores.

An **alternate tie-break ranking** is defined by reordering the priority of secondary
attributes:

π_alt = Sort(sᵢ, aᵢ with reordered priority).

Fix a numerical tolerance τ > 0 and consider cases where the boundary margin satisfies

mₖ ≤ τ.

In this regime, documents near the top-k boundary may form a tie group in which
|sᵢ − sⱼ| ≤ τ. Even when

Δsᵢ ≈ 0,

the top-k set or ordering may differ between π, π_score, and π_alt, due solely to the
choice of deterministic tie-breaking rules.

This motivates a notion of **tie-break sensitivity**, which can be measured, for example, by:

- an indicator of whether the top-k set differs between π and π_score, and 
- a distance between orderings restricted to tie groups (e.g. inversion count or
  Kendall τ distance).

These quantities capture **decision-level instability** that is independent of
numerical error in similarity computation and arises purely from secondary ordering
criteria.

---

## 5. Interpretation and Scope

The preceding formulation highlights several structural features of **TF-IDF–based similarity systems** that become especially clear when the pipeline is expressed in 
**operator-level form**:

- **IDF sensitivity is governed by explicit logarithmic dependence** on corpus size and document-frequency counts, as seen in 
  Δidf(t) = log((1 + N′)/(1 + df′(t))) − log((1 + N)/(1 + df(t))). 
  This makes the stability of IDF directly traceable to perturbations in corpus composition.

- **TF-IDF perturbations admit an explicit decomposition** into *local* (TF), *global* (IDF), and *second-order interaction* terms, providing a transparent mechanism for 
  understanding how small edits propagate through the embedding.

- **Cosine similarity admits a geometric interpretation** as the cosine of the angle between *sparse, non-negative vectors*. This framing clarifies how sparsity 
  patterns and IDF scaling influence angular distortion under perturbation.

- **Ranking robustness can be characterised in terms of score-separation margins**, with explicit sufficient conditions ensuring invariance under bounded perturbations. In the 
  context of **content-based k-nearest-neighbour recommendation**, such ranking stability directly governs the stability of induced neighbourhoods.

- **Ranking stability is governed primarily by margin distributions, rather than by aggregate or average score changes alone.** 
  In particular, the presence of small score-separation margins near decision boundaries dominates stability behaviour, even when aggregate similarity scores are 
  numerically well-conditioned.

- **A long tail of near-zero margins can imply rare but extreme fragility.** 
  While most rankings may be stable under small perturbations, documents near top-k boundaries with vanishing margins can induce abrupt changes in neighbourhood 
  structure under otherwise negligible score variation.

- **Deterministic tie-breaking introduces non-perturbative discontinuities.**  
  Even in the absence of meaningful numerical perturbation (Δs ≈ 0), ranking outcomes may change due solely to secondary ordering rules, underscoring that 
  stability of computed similarities does not guarantee stability of downstream decisions.

The emphasis throughout is on **derivational transparency** rather than algorithmic optimisation. No dimensionality reduction, latent-semantic modelling, or neural 
embeddings are introduced. The goal is to expose the **algebraic and geometric structure** of the TF-IDF pipeline in a form suitable for 
**perturbation analysis**, **stability reasoning**, and **controlled experimentation**.

---

## 6. Limitations

Several limitations of the present framework should be noted:

- **High-dimensional sparsity complicates geometric intuition.**  
  TF-IDF vectors inhabit a large, sparse subset of ℝⁿ, where small changes in support can
  produce disproportionately large angular effects. This can lead to instability in
  similarity scores and, by extension, in induced k-NN neighbourhoods.

- **Cosine similarity becomes unstable for low-norm vectors.**  
  When documents are short or contain few in-vocabulary tokens, the norms ‖u‖₂ and ‖v‖₂
  may become small, increasing sensitivity to perturbations in similarity values. In
  such regimes, score-separation margins tend to shrink, making ranking outcomes
  increasingly susceptible to domination by deterministic tie-breaking rules rather
  than by similarity geometry alone.

- **Smoothed IDF reduces but does not eliminate volatility associated with rare tokens.**  
  Tokens with very low document frequency remain highly sensitive to corpus perturbations,
  even under smoothing, and can dominate similarity computations in sparse settings.

- **Deterministic tie-breaking can dominate outcomes under near-ties.**  
  When score-separation margins fall below numerical tolerance, ranking outcomes may be
  determined primarily by secondary ordering rules. In such cases, stability results
  based solely on similarity scores or margin conditions do not fully capture
  decision-level instability in the induced rankings.

- **No numerical optimisation techniques are employed.**  
  The implementation intentionally avoids stabilising transformations, such as
  sublinear TF scaling, vector normalisation variants, or dimensionality reduction, in
  order to preserve **analytical clarity** and direct interpretability of perturbation
  effects.

Accordingly, the framework is intended for **analytical**, **educational**, and
**controlled experimental use**, rather than production deployment or large-scale
retrieval tasks.

---

## 7. Experimental Protocol and Results

This section presents the evaluation protocol and empirical results corresponding to
the two stability questions analysed throughout this work:

- (A1) How score-separation margins govern the stability of similarity-based rankings
  under bounded perturbations.
- (A2) How deterministic tie-breaking rules induce decision-level discontinuities in
  the presence of near-ties.

The purpose of the experiments is not to benchmark retrieval quality against external
baselines, but to characterise stability and fragility properties of the implemented
TF-IDF + cosine ranking pipeline under a fixed, deterministic preprocessing, embedding,
and ranking configuration.

---

### 7.1 Query Set and Evaluation Setup

**Corpus and representation.**  
All documents are embedded using the fixed preprocessing map, vocabulary construction,
smoothed IDF definition, and TF normalisation specified in §§2.1–2.2. Similarity scores
are computed exclusively using cosine similarity as defined in §2.3.

**Query construction.**  
Experiments are conducted using the following query construction strategies, as
implemented in the repository:

- **User-profile queries:** a query document is constructed by aggregating text from a
  user’s interacted items (e.g. liked, viewed, or favourited), and embedded into the
  same TF-IDF space as the corpus.
- **Leave-one-out evaluation:** for users with multiple interactions, one interacted
  item is removed and treated as a held-out target; the remaining interactions form
  the query profile.

Other supported query modes (e.g. item-as-query) are part of the implementation but
are not evaluated in the present experiments.

**k values.**  
All stability metrics are evaluated for k ∈ {5, 10, 20, 50}.

**Near-tie tolerance.**  
A fixed numerical tolerance τ > 0 defines the near-tie regime. Two similarity scores
sᵢ and sⱼ are treated as indistinguishable whenever |sᵢ − sⱼ| ≤ τ, and tie groups are
defined as in §2.3.3. The value of τ is chosen to exceed floating-point noise while
remaining small relative to typical score separations. All tie-break sensitivity
results are explicitly conditional on this choice of τ.

All reported distributions are computed over the full set of evaluated queries;
the exact number of queries and users depends on the dataset configuration provided
in the repository.

Unless stated otherwise, all reported results use a fixed τ across queries.

---

### 7.2 Margin Distributions and Ranking Stability (A1)

For each query, let (r₁, r₂, …) denote the ranking induced by sorting similarity scores
in decreasing order. Boundary and within-top-k margins are defined as in §§2.3.2 and 4.4:

- mₖ = score(rₖ) − score(rₖ₊₁)
- m_min^top = min_{1 ≤ j < k} (score(rⱼ) − score(rⱼ₊₁))

For each k ∈ {5, 10, 20, 50}, empirical distributions of mₖ and m_min^top are computed
across all evaluated queries.

**Reported statistics.**
- Percentile summaries of mₖ and m_min^top (including lower-tail, median, and upper-tail
  behaviour).
- Corresponding flip radii εₖ^flip = mₖ / 2, which provide sufficient bounds for top-k
  stability under uniform score perturbations.

**Visualisation.**
- Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) or histograms of mₖ.
- ECDFs or histograms of m_min^top.

These distributions characterise whether ranking stability is typical (margins well
separated from zero) or fragile (substantial mass concentrated near zero), particularly
at decision boundaries.

---

### 7.3 Tie-Break Ablations and Decision Sensitivity (A2)

To isolate decision-level effects arising from deterministic secondary ordering,
rankings are recomputed under the following sorting operators (§4.5):

- **Full ranking:** π = Sort(sᵢ, aᵢ)
- **Score-only ranking:** π_score = Sort(sᵢ, idᵢ)
- **Alternate tie-break ranking:** π_alt = Sort(sᵢ, aᵢ with reordered priority)

For each query and each k, the following quantities are measured:

- **Top-k disagreement rate:** the fraction of queries for which the top-k set differs
  between π and π_score, and between π and π_alt.
- **Within-top-k reordering:** an ordering distance restricted to tie-affected
  subsets (e.g. inversion count or Kendall τ distance).

Results are stratified by the boundary margin mₖ relative to τ, since tie-break effects
are expected to concentrate in the near-tie regime mₖ ≤ τ.

**Visualisation.**
- Probability of top-k disagreement as a function of mₖ, highlighting the transition
  region around mₖ ≈ τ.

This analysis separates numerical stability of similarity scores from instability
introduced purely by deterministic decision rules.

---

### 7.4 Constructed Near-Tie Case Study

To illustrate decision-level discontinuities explicitly, a constructed near-tie case
is reported for a fixed query:

- Two documents A and B are identified such that |s_A − s_B| ≤ τ near the top-k
  boundary (or as adjacent elements within the top-k).
- The tuple (s_A, s_B, mₖ, τ) and the associated tie-break attributes (a_A, a_B) are
  reported.
- Ranking outcomes under π, π_score, and π_alt are compared.

This case study is **deliberately illustrative rather than representative**, and serves to make
concrete the fact that ranking outcomes can change with Δs ≈ 0, driven solely by
deterministic tie-breaking rules. The example directly instantiates the decision-level
discontinuities analysed abstractly in §§2.3.3 and 4.5.

**Implementation and exposition**

Implementation includes the full TF-IDF similarity pipeline, explicit perturbation analysis tooling, **stability 
profiling via score-separation margins**, and a **tie-break ablation framework** for isolating decision-level 
discontinuities in ranking outcomes.

**Mathematical and theoretical foundations**  
This work draws on **classical information retrieval methodology**, including TF-IDF weighting and vector-space models 
(Salton; Manning et al.), and is supported by established treatments of **numerical stability**, **conditioning**, and 
**perturbation behaviour** in high-dimensional vector spaces (Higham; Trefethen & Bau).

The interpretation of similarity scores in terms of **content-based k-nearest-neighbour ranking and neighbourhood structure** 
follows classical nearest-neighbour and similarity-search perspectives (Cover & Hart), without introducing learning-based methods.

Broader contextual connections to feature representations and similarity-based reasoning draw on standard statistical learning 
references (Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman; Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David). Supplementary intuition and terminology are informed by 
widely used online references on **TF-IDF**, **cosine similarity**, and **vector-space models**.
